RUN npm install
CMD ["npm","run","start"]
# First we tell the docker what OS we want to use here we are using node:16-alpine  which is a node-based environment and only uses those systems of an OS that are needed to run a node application. We do this by adding the command FROM node:16-alpine
# Next we tell our docker application that you need to set the working directory to /app where all our code would be copied. We do this by using the command WORKDIR /app
# After that we use the command COPY . . , which basically copies all the code to the working directory, ignoring all the things we asked our dockerignore to ignore.
# Next we want to expose the port at which our application runs. This example application run on port 8080 so we expose that port by saying EXPOSE 8080. Change this if your server.js or index.js listens on a different port.
# Now that our code is copied, we need to install the node modules on our Docker container so we run the command RUN npm install
# And lastly we want to tell our application the command we want to use to run the application. We do that by using the command CMD [“npm”,”start”]. Thing to notice here is that each word in our run command is written in double quotes separated by a comma. That is a notation used by docker.
# And thats all! We have successfully written the docker file for our application. Next we need to build and run the file in order to create docker image and container.
